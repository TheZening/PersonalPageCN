Hello and Welcome!

Thank you for visiting my personal page. Here, you’ll find some of my latest projects alongside insights from previous research. My main focus lies in mesoscopic systems and other fascinating areas within condensed matter physics.

In 2019, I graduated from the University of New South Wales with First Class Honors in Physics. With the encouragement of my supervisor, Prof. Dimitrie Culcer, I began a Ph.D. in his group, focusing on quantum transport and mesoscopic systems. I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the group.

I owe much of my development to the guidance and inspiration of my teachers, supervisors, and peers, each of whom has played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding and fueling my passion for exploring the brilliant ideas of both past and present researchers.

I hope my posts provide clarity and, perhaps, spark curiosity—without causing too much confusion along the way!

Thank you again for stopping by!
